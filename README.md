# JustMobility

JustMobility has the potential to be integrated with almost any IoT enabled vehicle. The Customers will never again 
register through classic administrative processes since they will use digital identities. The vehicle needs no human 
oversight to validate the credentials by comparing the hash with the blockchain.

The KILT protocol enables this sharing of the data while staying under full control over it.
